# Contributing to the PPLBandaged Project

## 📌 General Guidelines

We welcome all contributions from the following list:
* Bug fixes
* Typo corrections
* Code formatting
* Refactoring that improves code structure without changing functionality
* Creating new features (see below)

### 🧩 Creating New Features

Adding new functionality can be a big and time-consuming task. You're welcome to contribute small features that don’t affect the API or other backend parts of the project.

If you have an idea for a larger feature — **please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/PPLBandage/pplbandage_site/issues/new)** and we’ll discuss how to bring it to life together ❤

### 🎨 Visual Changes

When making visual (CSS/design) changes, make sure they follow the overall style of the site. Don't make changes that break the site's visual consistency.
If you're unsure — it’s best to start a conversation in an **[issue](https://github.com/PPLBandage/pplbandage_site/issues/new)**

### 🌐 Network-Related Changes

Please do not add dependencies on third-party or personal APIs when submitting your PR. Pull requests that include them will likely be rejected.

**DO NOT ADD MALICIOUS CODE** that violates our [Rules](https://pplbandage.ru/tos) or [Privacy Policy](https://pplbandage.ru/tos#PP)

## 🧾 Code Style

Please follow the overall code style used in the project. Use the provided <kbd>.prettier</kbd> files to ensure your code is formatted properly.

## 🚫 What Is Not Welcome

* Removing existing features without a clear reason
* Adding features or content that break the rules of PepeLand, Twitch, GitHub, or Discord
* Irrelevant content unrelated to the theme of the site
* Phishing links, ads, IP loggers, backdoors, or similar harmful code
* Functionality that bypasses restrictions or accesses private user data
* Meaningless commits (e.g. random copy-paste or spammy push)
* Editing global configuration, service, or deployment workflow files

If you’re ever unsure — just ask! It’s always better to clarify before sending a PR than to waste time.  
**Thank you for contributing to the PPLBandage Project!** 💖
